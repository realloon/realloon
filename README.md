### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Programming is my passion and love. I enjoy writing code as a form of creation that excites me. I want to learn more and create more, and I hope that my creations can benefit both myself and others.

> You don't have to be good at something to enjoy it.

Although my skill level is poor, I still enjoy it.
